### SPP(Small Python Project) pt.1   BlackJack
This is a good way of keeping up with your if else statements and loops, not to mention its fun to play obviously! It was tough however my love for card games really helped me understand the logic of the code and made me a better developer! Using loops i was able to make these functions automated, on top of this, I really focused on making the code clean because I would hate to be one of those guys that makes the code difficult to understand. I did leave a URL for understanding the chr function because that stumpped me early into the project. I can't stress this enough though, if you have a love for a specific project, it will help you understand the code more.
