# SmallPythonProjects
### My First small project that I worked on is a Blackjack game on Python.
This is a good way of shapening your functions and loops, not to mention its fun to play obviously! It was tough however my love for card games really helped me understand the logic of the code and made me a better developer! Using loops i was able to make these functions automated in a way, on top of this, I really focused on making the code clean because I would hate to be one of those guys that makes the code difficult to understand
